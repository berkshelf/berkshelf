Feature: berks update
  Background:
    * the cookbook store has the cookbooks:
      | fake | 0.1.0 |
      | fake | 0.2.0 |
      | fake | 1.0.0 |
      | ekaf | 1.0.0 |
      | ekaf | 1.0.1 |

  Scenario: Without a cookbook specified
    And I have a Berksfile pointing at the local Berkshelf API with:
      """
      cookbook 'ekaf', '~> 1.0.0'
      cookbook 'fake', '~> 0.1'
      """
    And I write to "Berksfile.lock" with:
      """
      DEPENDENCIES
        ekaf (~> 1.0.0)
        fake (~> 0.1)

      GRAPH
        ekaf (1.0.0)
        fake (0.1.0)
      """
    When I successfully run `berks update`
    Then the file "Berksfile.lock" should contain:

  Scenario: With a single cookbook specified
    And I have a Berksfile pointing at the local Berkshelf API with:
